#### A tale of two values
when it comes to software you usually dealing with two fundamental values, behaviour and the structure. 
The behaviour stands the funtionality of the software where as the structure is basically the architecture of the software.

#### Behaviour
The behaviour of the system is pretty straight forward, it is the ability to do what the requirements basically wanted it to do.


####  Architecuture
where as the architecture is geared towards the shape of the software that allows it to be flexible enough to accomodate new changes easily.


#### Greater value
The greater value here always is simple the architecture, here the author argues that
if a system is flexible and it is behaving properly since it is flexible it open to change quickly 
but when an system isnt flexible but works , you really do have a big problem.

Anothe reason why architecture is greater value is why product managers might not necessarily see the 
benefit of architecture, once a new change seems to be cost more, the pm is mostly likely to blame you
for working on a system that basically the cost as more to change.



#### Fight for the architecture
So here the encourages as that as dev it is responsibility to struggle, to fight because the pm lacks the skills and technical
know how to see the importance to thinking about architecture.
