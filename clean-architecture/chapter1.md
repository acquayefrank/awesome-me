### What is architecture and design ?
Fundamentally this chapter was just about disputing the obvious adage that architecture is 
the high level view of a software where as design is mostly the detailed structures and decisions
that make up software.

He arrives at this by comparing the word architecture to an architect works and makes reference to 
documents provided by an architects for his own house. 
While the documents provides high level design(the rooms, the elevations, and the height) of the house, it was common to see some details
around where the lights will be and which switches will control which lights, where the furnace will be placed as well as the size
and placement of water pumps and other details that will normally be called not high level details.

He goes further to see the work of an architecgture as a high level view is incomplete without 
considering the details.
So software architecture and design are just the same.


#### What is the goal of software design and how do we measure it ?
The ultimate goal of a software design is to minimize the amount of human resources to build and maintain the required system.
We can measure the quality of software as the effort required to meet what the customer wants.


#### Case Studay
 - Engineering team keep growing as we release new versions of a software
 - Productivity reduced as more developers where added while new software was released.
 - When the output required to archieve the required systems is directly proportianal to the number of developers those are systems of a big mess where
 no thoughts was given to design and cleaniness of the code over time.



#### What went wrong ?
 - the tortoise and hare - Moving too fast as a result of being overconfidence in your ability to come back to fix your mess.
 - Slow and steady wins the race in the long run
 - the part of the brains sleeps when it comes to good, clean code, matters.
 - believing that writing messy code makes them fast in the long run

#### Experiment by Jason Gorman
Code with tdd for 3 days and there was decrease in the time spent on the time each day.
Code with without any this tdd cuases them to spend more time on finishing the problem over the next 3 days.



The only way to go fast is to go well. 



Conclusion
If you going to valuable company whos cost does not increase over time, you will have to pay much attention to 
quality of your software architecture. But you cant pay attention to something you dont know. The goal of this book
is to show what it means to have a good software architecture.



#### Part 2 - Starting with the bricks
Software architecture begins with code
Alan laid the fundations for programming 
Alan turing was the first to understand programs was simply data
His language of choice was binary

Revoulutions
The days of languages
1954 -assemblers
Grace hopper invented Ao first compiler
1953 - fotran

The days of programming paradigms
A paridgm tells you which programming structures to use, and when to use them
