### Structured Programming
    - Edger Wyde Dikstra
    - Netherlands very fist programmer
    in this chapter the author is trying to create a mental picture of the environment under which wyde worked.

#### Proof
 - Programming is hard and programmers dont do it very well.
he wanted to use proven structures that will be tied to the code, to ensure that the code does what it suppose to do.

use of goto prevents certain modules from broken down into smaller units.
Preventinging devide and conquer approach necessary for resonable proofs.

Where goto did not have a problem it seems they were normally used
in simple if then else, do while until and 
which are basically selective and iteractive control structures.


sequence top down approach
selection if statements 
and iteration and while loops

structured was born when we realised that same control structures that makes a code easy to reasonable proof wher  equal to the fundamental structures that allows you to write any program.

he provided mathematical sequential structures and then iteration.


goto- unrestricted transfer of control

#### A harmful Proclamation

he wrote a letter to the editor of CACM which didnt go quite well with the wold and so over the years the argument that goto statement was harmful peterred.

now most modern languages dont even include that.

#### Functional Decomposition
structural programming encourages deviding problems into seperate function and then each function now solves each problem using the 3 structures. 

sequence
select
and 
iteration

#### No Formal Proofs
dikstra goal of using ecludian theorems to as a means to ensure quality of software never reached it goal.

#### Science to the rescue
science unlike maths encourages falsifying hypothesis that is provable unlike mathematics which encourages proving that are provable

so the scientific sounds like a suitable approach to software development but it is not the only way

#### Test
Testing a program only shows the presence of bugs and not the absence of bugs.
This basically means we show correctness of our software only by testing within our best effort but it does not mean
there are no bugs.

Software is like scientific method it is not provable but only falsified to show incorrectness without we 
say the hypothesis is true or the program in our case works.



#### Conclusion
