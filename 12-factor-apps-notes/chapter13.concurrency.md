Cloud native applications should scale out using the process model
 - Create multiple processes and distribute the load among them (Scale out or horizontally scale)
 - Dont make a big process by increassing cpu, ram and other resources
 - You can assign each type of work to a different process eg (web requests, specific worker process)
 - Encourage disposable share nothing processes
