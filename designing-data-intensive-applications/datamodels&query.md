Data model
An application can be considered as layers of data model representations.
For example as a developer you will initially model ur problem solutions into objects, data structures and api that will manipulate these
when it comes to storing these data models, you will now consider which database, the developers of these database also 
have to provide a model to represent the data u want to store, which can tables or json in some nosql databases.
The hardware developer also helps the database developer by providing a way to model the data provided as electric pulses.
